# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project
Author: Charles Phillips
Title: Association of nutrition trajectory and outcomes in pediatric leukemia and lymphoma patients

This file contains the files for Charles Phillips BMIN503/EPID600 final project.

This is a guide for anyone who needs to view or analyze the data used for the completion of this project, Association of nutrition trajectory and outcomes in pediatric leukemia and lymphoma patients. 

The goal for this analysis was to determine the optimal number of trajectories to describe BMI patterns in pediatric leukemia and lymphoma patients and to compare the mortality rate of patients with a lower mean BMI compared with patients with a normal BMI. 

Excluding this README, 6 files are included in this repository. A description of the files is as follows:
1. "bmi_data_fake" is the raw csv file containing fabricated BMI data for an imaginary cohort of leukemia and lymphoma patients. It is modeled after the BMI z-score data found in the PEDSnet dataset. 
2. "demo_dx_death_fake" is the raw csv file containing fabricated demographic, diagnosis, and mortality data for an imaginary cohort of leukemia and lymphoma patients. It is modeled after data found in the PEDSnet dataset.
3. "phillips_final_project.rmd" contains the rmd file with the analysis along with a written description.
4. "phillips_final_project.html" contains the html version of the analysis file.
5. "cp_final_project" was a file created in error and can be ignored.
6. "final_project_template" is a draft version of the final project and can be ignored.
